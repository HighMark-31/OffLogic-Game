# 🎮 **OffLogic Game**

The game that lies, misleads, and betrays your expectations —
yet dares you to **win by doing the impossible at the perfect moment**.

**OffLogic Game** doesn’t play by the rules. It *breaks* them.
Every click, every choice, every instinct… is up for a chaotic twist.
Just when you think you’ve mastered it… it changes. ⚡

## 🕹 **About OffLogic Game**

OffLogic Game is the ultimate reflex challenge for developers and UI designers.
It’s an interactive experience testing your **coding speed, precision, and aesthetic sense**.

**Choose your timeline:**

* ⏳ **Vintage Theme** – raw, command-line power, built by **Roman**
* 💎 **Modern Theme** – sleek, glassmorphic elegance, developed by **HighMark**

Each mode delivers a unique gameplay experience designed to **celebrate the evolution of software development**.

## 🤯 **How It Works**

Every round is a new mind-bending challenge:

1. **Command Prompt** 📝
   The smart engine randomly selects instructions like:
   *“Click the red button.”*
   *“Don’t move your mouse.”*
   *“Type BANANA to survive.”*

2. **Hidden Logic Shift** 🔀
   The real solution may require:

   * following the command
   * ignoring it
   * doing the opposite
   * performing an unrelated action

3. **Instant Feedback** ⚡
   Success or failure is immediate. The game **laughs at the unprepared**.

**TRAE** was fundamental in powering the smart engine, logic shifts, and score tracking.
Without it, OffLogic Game wouldn’t feel this smooth, unpredictable, and addictive.

## 🧠 **How TRAE Helped Us**

**[TRAE](https://trae.ai/)**, the proprietary AI development IDE provided by the hackathon, was **crucial** for OffLogic Game:

* Helped design and test the **smart random engine** that chooses instructions and logic shifts
* Made **score tracking and round evaluation** reliable and instant
* Assisted in **iterating rapidly** on both Vintage and Modern themes
* Streamlined **debugging and event management** in complex gameplay scenarios

Without TRAE, achieving this level of fluidity, unpredictability, and polish would have been **much slower and more error-prone**.

## **Key Features**

* 🎲 **Unpredictable gameplay** – every round is a new mental puzzle
* 🔄 **Logic inversion system** – just when you think you know, think again
* 🎯 **Visual bait events** – tempting you into mistakes
* 🏆 **Score system** – reward your mastery of chaos
* 💻 **Browser-playable** – zero downloads, immediate fun
* ⏳ **Two fully themed timelines** – Vintage & Modern
