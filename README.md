# **OffLogic Game**

The game that lies, misleads, betrays your expectations —
and still dares you to win by doing the *wrong* thing at the *right* time.

**OffLogic Game** flips every rule of classic gaming upside down.
Nothing works the way you think. Nothing stays consistent.
And every time you believe you've figured out the pattern…
the pattern changes.

## **What Is OffLogic Game?**

OffLogic Game is a chaotic, web-based mini-game powered by AI-generated instructions.
Each round, the game gives you a command. Simple, right?

Not really.

Because in OffLogic Game:

* Sometimes you must follow the instruction.
* Sometimes you must do the opposite.
* Sometimes ignoring the command is the actual solution.
* Sometimes the correct action isn’t mentioned anywhere.
* And sometimes the game pretends to help you… just to betray you.

Winning requires embracing the absurd.

## 🧩 **How It Works**

Every round contains three components:

1. **AI Instruction**
   AI generates an unpredictable prompt:
   “Click the red button.”
   “Don’t move your mouse.”
   “Type BANANA to survive.”
   “Trust me, this one is easy.”

2. **Hidden Logic Shift**
   Behind the scenes, the game randomly decides whether the correct action is:

   * following the command
   * doing the opposite
   * ignoring everything
   * performing an unrelated action
   * resisting temptations (Anti-Clicker mode)

3. **Instant Feedback**
   You either survive the round…
   or the game laughs at your attempt.

Success = embracing uncertainty.

## 🏆 **Why It Fits “Dumb Ways to Win”**

Because OffLogic Game **forces you to win by making intentionally bad or nonsensical choices**.
It's a complete reversal of traditional game logic — and exactly the type of chaotic energy the theme calls for.

Unconventional? Yes.
Silly? Absolutely.
Addictive? Way more than it should be.
